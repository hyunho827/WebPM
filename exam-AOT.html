                A character from the manga "Attack on Titan" by Hajime Isayama.

                When referring to it, it is usually called 'Sergeant Levi' or 'Sergeant Levi' by attaching the rank of sergeant.
                
                The position, not the rank, is a sergeant or sergeant, which is higher than the squad leader and immediately below the commander.
                
                When looking at the authority of the work, it seems to be about the rank of a field officer. After the number of soldiers in the corps is drastically reduced in Part 2,
                
                he almost exercises the position of a general. In the survey corps, he is in the second position, along with Mike, following the leader Alvin Smith.

                You can guess how highly he ranks the head of the military police, Nile Dock, in the fact that no one says anything about him even if he speaks rudely. In the domestic version,
                
                it has been refined into honorifics, but Levi is not particularly polite even to President Darris Sakkle, who holds the highest position in the three corps. Not just talking half-heartedly,
                
                but talking with his back turned. So, it can be seen that there is no one to whom Levi speaks with respect. A few years later, in the second division,
                
                it seems that he has become the most authoritative position under the leader.
